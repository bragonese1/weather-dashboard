# Weather Dashboard
## Description

The Task Board serves the purpose of allowing the user to enter a task with an associated date and drag and drop that task in the columns 'To Do', 'In Progress', and 'Done'.
Depending on the date used to create the task, the task will be color coded according to whether the task is due today, overdue, or there is still time.
